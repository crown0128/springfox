== Answers to common questions and problems

*Q. Why does springfox ignore the http status code in the return value of a controller method?*

A. https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/822[Reference #822]

*Q. What is the relationship between swagger-ui and springfox-swagger-ui?*

A. It can be a little confusing :open_mouth:

  - Swagger Spec is a specification
  - Swagger Api - an implementation of that specification that supports jax-rs, restlet, jersey etc.
  - Springfox libraries in general - is another implementation of the specification focused on the spring based ecosystem
  - Swagger.js and Swagger-ui - Are client libraries in javascript that can consume swagger specification
  - springfox-swagger-ui - the one that you're referring to, is just packaging swagger-ui in a convenient way so that
  spring services can serve it up.

*Q. I use GSON and don't use Jackson, What should I do?*

A. Thanks to https://github.com/chrishuttonch[@chrishuttonch] for describing the solution to https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/867[this issue]

  TIP: I switched on the excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation() which meant that none of the objects would produce any data. To get around this I created several serialisers for the following classes:

[source,java]
----
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.service.ApiListing.class, new SwaggerApiListingJsonSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.spring.web.json.Json.class, new SwaggerJsonSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.SwaggerResource.class, new SwaggerResourceSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.service.ResourceListing.class, new SwaggerResourceListingJsonSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.SwaggerResource.class, new SwaggerResourceSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.SecurityConfiguration.class, new SwaggerSecurityConfigurationSerializer())
.registerTypeAdapter(springfox.documentation.swagger.web.UiConfiguration.class, new SwaggerUiConfigurationSerializer());

*Q. I get an NPE during application startup in a spring-boot app?*

A. Thanks to https://github.com/shasti421[@shasti421] for providing the solution

  TIP: Running in debugger revealed that i had two instances of WebApplicationInitializers in my war. Spring is
  refreshing context with each one and is resulting in second instance of OptimizedModelPropertiesProvider without
  onApplicationEvent call. I was able to fix it by removing second WebApplicationInitializer in my code. Seems  this is
   related to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/221[spring-boot issue #221]

*Q. How do we use Java 8 types esply. LocalDateTime?*

A. Typically these are handled via `Docket#directModelSubstitute(LocalDateTime.class, String.class)`. If these
  are ISO 8601 dates that conform to a string format i.e. `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm'Z'`. However you won't have any format or
  validation info.

*Q. How does one use @ModelAttribute annotation. It doesn't seem to render the model properties as scalar properties?*

A. In order for @ModelAttribute annotated types to be inferred the properties need to be bean properties.

  If the intent is immutability and passing in an object, the preferred approach is to make that a request body, in which
  case the immutability will follow the rules laid out by jackson to determine what constitutes a request "view" of the
  request object.

  getters/setters are a clean way to indicate what values can come in to a operation. While it may not be apparent in a
  trivial model with one level nesting; the design choice will become clear when we realize that model attributes can be
  arbitrarily nested. Consider (pseudo code in c# for brevity)

[source,csharp]
----
Person {String firstName {get;set;}, String lastName {get;set;}, Category category {get;set;}}
Category {String name {get;set;}, String description {get;}}
----

  So one could set properties
  firstName
  lastName
  category.name

  Now we don't want category to be able to set description via the operation, how do we control/specify that?

  it makes it hard to reason about which fields in an objects are not intended to be mutated. This is the reason we
  chose to limit it to objects that expose getters and setters.

NOTE: I know spring supports fields as well, and it will fall back to fields if setters are not found

*Q. How should we resolve multiple object mappers available as beans especially when using spring-hateoas?*

A. The idea is to provide a `@Primary` ObjectMapper.

  Based on answer provided by @prabhat1790 in https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/890[issue #890]

[source,java]
----
  private static final String SPRING_HATEOAS_OBJECT_MAPPER = "_halObjectMapper";

  @Autowired
  @Qualifier(SPRING_HATEOAS_OBJECT_MAPPER)
  private ObjectMapper springHateoasObjectMapper;

  @Primary
  @Bean
  @Order(value=Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)
  @DependsOn(SPRING_HATEOAS_OBJECT_MAPPER)
  public ObjectMapper objectMapper() {
    return springHateoasObjectMapper;
  }
----

and set the order of the other bean to lowest precedence.

*Q. How do I use this library to aggregate swagger-enabled resources from multiple services?*

A.  Logical explanation of how one might go about doing this is available in the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/swagger-swaggersocket/multiple/swagger-swaggersocket/g8fgSGUCrYs/A8Ms_lFOoN4J[swagger google group]

    Additionally https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1001#issuecomment-147609243[this comment] further
    discusses issues with doing this.

*Q. Why are my api params marked as required=false?*

A. This is because of how plugins work and how their priority layers information

   @PathVariables are always marked as required.
   @ApiParam is an optional annotation to describe additional meta-information like description etc.
   @ApiParam#required() is defaulted to false, unless you set it to true.

   Springfox uses plugins to layer information. There are a set of plugins that are spring specific that apply the
   inferred values on to the internal service models. The swagger annotation related metadata is layered on top of the
   spring-mvc descriptions. By definition, plugins don't know and should not know about each other or previously
   inferred values (in your case required attribute).

   So if you choose to augment the definitions with @ApiParam then you need to be explicit and set the value to true.

*Q. How does one write a plugin to for e.g. make default all types required and only some not required?*
A.  To do this, you'd have to
    - add an alternate type rule for `Optional<T>` see `genericModelSubstitutes` in docket
    - implement your own https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-spi/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/spi/schema/ModelPropertyBuilderPlugin.java#L26[ModelPropertyBuilderPlugin]
    - and override the read only property if you find an `Optional` type. See https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-swagger-common/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/swagger/schema/ApiModelPropertyPropertyBuilder.java#L35[here] for an example.

    Keep in mind that you need the plugin to fire after this plugin... so order it accordingly

*Q. Why are all my operations not showing in the UI?*

A.  This is a known limitation of swagger-spec. There is a work around for it but, swagger-ui won't play nice with it.
    I have a https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/pull/541[PR] which address that issue. Would be great if you vote
    up the PR and the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/291[underlying issue]

    UPDATE: This https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/pull/541[PR] has been closed!

*Q. How would one partition apis based on versions?*

A.  Excerpted from an explanation for https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/963[issue 963]...

    (springfox) uses the context path as the starting point.

    What you really need to is to define a dynamic servlet registration and create 2 dockets .. one for **api** and
    one for **api/v2**. This [SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23049736/working-with-multiple-dispatcher-servlets-in-a-spring-application) might help

[source,xml]
----
    ...
      Dynamic servlet = servletContext.addServlet("v1Dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(ctx1));
            servlet.addMapping("/api");
            servlet.setLoadOnStartup(1);

      Dynamic servlet = servletContext.addServlet("v2Dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(ctx2));
            servlet.addMapping("/api/v2");
            servlet.setLoadOnStartup(1);

*Q. How does one configure swagger-ui for non-springboot applications?*

A.  Excerpted from https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/983[issue 983]...
    I was able to get it working by modifying the dispatcherServlet to listen on /* , but this prevented swagger-ui.html
    from being served.  To fix this to let the swagger-ui.html bypass the dispatcherServlet i had to create a new
    servlet mapping:

[source,xml]
----
    <servlet>
    			<servlet-name>RestServlet</servlet-name>
    			<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
    			<init-param>
    				<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
    				<param-value></param-value>
    			</init-param>
    			<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
    		</servlet>

    		<servlet-mapping>
    			<servlet-name>default</servlet-name>
    				<url-pattern>/swagger-ui.html</url-pattern>
    		</servlet-mapping>

    		<servlet-mapping>
    			<servlet-name>RestServlet</servlet-name>
    				<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    		</servlet-mapping>
----

    Also had to let the webjar through the dispatcher servlet:


    `<mvc:resources mapping="/webjars/**" location="classpath:/META-INF/resources/webjars/"/>`

    Kinda tricky to get working, but it works.  Perhaps there is a better way to remap swagger-ui.html or let it pass
    through the dispatcherServlet.

*Q. How does one create rules to substitute list and array items?*

A.  If the following types...

[source,java]
----
    ToSubstitute[] array;
    List<ToSubstitute> list;
----

    Need to look like this over the wire...

[source,java]
----
    Substituted[] array;
    List<Substituted> list;
----


    This is how the rules need to be configured

[source,java]
----
    rules.add(newRule(resolver.arrayType(ToSubstitute), resolver.arrayType(Substituted)))
    rules.add(newRule(resolver.resolve(List, ToSubstitute), resolver.resolve(List, Substituted)))
----

*Q. How does one configure a docket with multiple protocols/schemes?*

A.  Use the `protocols` method to configure the docket to indicate supported schemes.

[source,java]
----
    docket.protocols(newHashSet("http", "https"))
----


*Q. How does one use springfox in a project with xml spring configuration?*

A. There is a demo application that describes https://github.com/springfox/springfox-demos/tree/master/spring-xml-swagger[how java-xml] configuration needs to be setup.
