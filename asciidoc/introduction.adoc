== Introduction

The Springfox suite of java libraries are all about automating the generation of machine and human readable
 specifications for JSON APIs written using the http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework[spring family of projects]. Springfox
 works by examining an application, once, at runtime to infer API semantics based on spring configurations, class structure and
 various compile time java Annotations.

=== History

Springfox has evolved from a project originally created by https://github.com/martypitt[Marty Pitt] and was named
_swagger-springmvc_. Much kudos goes to Marty.

=== Goals

. To extend support for a number of the evolving standards targeted at JSON API specification and documentation
such
as: http://swagger.io/[swagger], http://raml.org/[RAML] and http://jsonapi.org/[jsonapi].

. To extend support for spring technologies other than
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html[spring webmvc]

=== What it's not

Endorsed or approved by the Spring Framework Contributors

=== Development Environment

- File >> open >> build.gradle
- Make sure to check the 'use the default gradle wrapper' option.
- First time build

```bash
./gradlew cleanIdea idea

```

- To get more output from any gralde commands/tasks append a `-i` (info) or `-d` (debug) e.g.
```bash
./gradlew build -i

```

==== Pre-Commit Build

- Code quality (code coverage, checkstyle)

```bash
./gradlew check
```

==== Building reference documentation

```groovy
 ./gradlew asciidoc --daemon //Using the gradle daemon here makes sense if this is being executed a lot
```

==== CI Enviroment

https://circleci.com/gh/springfox/springfox[Circle CI]

=== Releasing

To release a non-snaphot version of Springfox:

- Execute the the release commands:
The below properties are required to run a release:
    - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
    - `BINTRAY_USERNAME`
    - `BINTRAY_PASSWORD`


Recommend using [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) with a `.env` file at the root of the repo.

```bash
    ./gradlew release publishDocs -PbintrayUsername=$BINTRAY_USERNAME -PbintrayPassword=$BINTRAY_PASSWORD
    -PreleaseType=<MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH> -i
```

The release steps are as follows:
- check that the git workspace is clean
- check that the local git branch is master
- check that the local git branch is the same as origin
- gradle test
- gradle check
- upload (publish) all artifacts to Bintray
- Bumps the project version in `version.properties`
- Git tag the release
- Git push

==== Snapshot

This is normally done by the CI server
```bash
./gradlew snapshot -PbintrayUsername=<bintrayUsername> -PbintrayPassword=<bintrayPassword>
```

==== Override deploy

To bypass the standard release flow and upload directly to bintray use the following task
- manually set the version in version.properties
```bash
./gradlew clean build bintrayUpload -PbintrayUsername=$BINTRAY_USERNAME -PbintrayPassword=$BINTRAY_PASSWORD -PreleaseType=<MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH>
 --stacktrace
```

==== Updating documentation

To update the docs for an existing release pass the `updateMode` switch
```
./gradlew publishDocs -PupdateMode
```
