== Architecture

=== Background
When we started work on 2.0 swagger specification we realized that we're rewriting the logic to infer the service
 models and the schema. So we decided to take a step back and break it out into a two step process. First infer the service
 model into an internal representation. Second create a mapping layer that can map the internal models to different specification formats.
 Out of the box we will support swagger 1.2 and swagger 2.0, but this leads us to the possibility of supporting other formats and
 other scenarios as well e.g. RAML, ALPS and hypermedia formats.

=== Component Model
The different Springfox modules are split up as shown below.

```ascii

  |                                  springfox-core                                         |

  | Contains the internal service and schema description models along with their builders.  |

  | Contains the service provider interfaces that can be used to extend and enrich the      |
  | service models, e.g. swagger specific annotation processors.                            |

         Configurations, and mapping layer that know how to convert the service models
         to swagger 1.2 and swagger 2.0 specification documents.
         Also contains the controller for each of the specific formats.
