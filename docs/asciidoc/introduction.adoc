== Introduction

The Springfox suite of java libraries are all about automating the generation of machine and human readable
 specifications for JSON APIs written using the http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework[spring family of projects]. Springfox
 works by examining an application, once, at runtime to infer API semantics based on spring configurations, class structure and
 various compile time java Annotations.

=== History

Springfox has evolved from a project originally created by https://github.com/martypitt[Marty Pitt] and was named
_swagger-springmvc_. Much kudos goes to Marty.

=== Goals

- To extend support for a number of the evolving standards targeted at JSON API specification and documentation
such as: http://swagger.io/[swagger], http://raml.org/[RAML] and http://jsonapi.org/[jsonapi].

- To extend support for spring technologies other than http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html[spring webmvc]

- Philosophically, we want to discourage using (swagger-core) annotations that are not material to the
service description at runtime. For e.g. the jackson annotations should always trump or have more weight than
`@ApiModelProperty` or for e.g. `@NotNull` or specifying @RequestParam#required should always win. Annotations are to
to be used only to supplement documentation or override/tweak the resulting spec in cases where its not possible to
infer service/schema characteristics.

=== What it's not

Endorsed or approved by the Spring Framework Contributors

=== Development Environment

- File >> open >> build.gradle
- Make sure to check the 'use the default gradle wrapper' option.
- First time build

[source,bash]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew cleanIdea idea
----

- To get more output from any gradle commands/tasks append a `-i` (info) or `-d` (debug) e.g.

[source,bash]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew build -i
----

- To publish to local maven repository

[source,bash]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal -i
----

NOTE: This build is optimized for releasing software to bintray/sonatype. In order for gradle to figure out
the version the gradle plugin relies on local folder being a cloned git repository. Downloading the source archive
and building will NOT work!

==== Pre-Commit Build

- Code quality (code coverage, checkstyle)

[source,bash]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew check
----

==== Building reference documentation
To build all the current documentation (builds hand written docs and javadocs):
[source,bash]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew allDocs
----

The docs are generated in the `build/all-docs` folder. To publish the current documentation (snapshot)

[source,bash]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew publishDocs
----

==== CI Environment

https://circleci.com/gh/springfox/springfox[Circle CI]

=== Releasing

To release a non-snapshot version of Springfox:

- Execute the the release commands:
The below properties are required to run a release:
    - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
    - `BINTRAY_USERNAME`
    - `BINTRAY_PASSWORD`


Recommend using [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) with a `.env` file at the root of the repo.

[source,]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    ./gradlew release publishDocs -PbintrayUsername=$BINTRAY_USERNAME -PbintrayPassword=$BINTRAY_PASSWORD
    -PreleaseType=<MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH> -i
----

The release steps are as follows:
- check that the git workspace is clean
- check that the local git branch is master
- check that the local git branch is the same as origin
- gradle test
- gradle check
- upload (publish) all artifacts to Bintray
- Bumps the project version in `version.properties`
- Git tag the release
- Git push

==== Snapshot

This is normally done by the CI server
[source,]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew snapshot -PbintrayUsername=<bintrayUsername> -PbintrayPassword=<bintrayPassword>
----

==== Override deploy

To bypass the standard release flow and upload directly to bintray use the following task
- manually set the version in version.properties
[source,]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew clean build bintrayUpload -PbintrayUsername=$BINTRAY_USERNAME -PbintrayPassword=$BINTRAY_PASSWORD -PreleaseType=<MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH>
 --stacktrace
----

==== Releasing documentation

To update the docs for an existing release pass the `updateMode` switch
[source,]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew releaseDocs
----
