== Swagger

Springfox supports both version https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md[1.2] and version
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md[2.0] of the http://swagger.io/[Swagger] specification.
Where possible, the Swagger 2.0 specification is preferable.

The https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations[swagger-core annotations], as provided by
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core[swagger-core], are typically used to decorate the java source code of an API which is bing
'swaggered'. Springfox is aware of the Swagger-Core Annotations and will favor those annotations over inferred defaults.

=== Swagger 1.2 vs Swagger 2.0
One major difference between the two swagger specification is the composition of the generated swagger documentation.

With Swagger 1.2 an applications API is represented as a `Resource Listing` and multiple `API Declarations` which has the
implication of producing https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#42-file-structure[multiple JSON files]

With Swagger 2.0 things are much simpler and an application's API can be represented in a single JSON file.

=== Moving from swagger-springmvc?

Here is https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/docs/transitioning-to-v2.md[a guide] to help with the
transition from 1.0.2 to 2.0.

Legacy documentation is https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/v1.0.2/README.md[available here].

=== Springfox configuration and demo applications

The https://github.com/springfox/springfox-demos[springfox-demos] repository contains a number of sample Spring application
which can be used a reference.
