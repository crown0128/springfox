== Plugins
=== Introduction
Any plugin or extensibility hook that is available https://github.com/springfox/springfox/tree/master/springfox-spi/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/spi[is available in the SPI
module]. In the `spi` module, anything that ends in `*Plugin` is generally an extensibility point that is meant for
library consumers to consume.

The bean validation (JSR-303) is a great example of a contribution to https://github.com/springfox/springfox/tree/master/springfox-bean-validators[support bean validations]. Its fairly simple and small in scope and should
give an idea how one goes about creating a plugin. Its a set of plugins are act on `ModelProperty`, hence they
are  implementations of `ModelPropertyBuilderPlugin`.

=== Plugins Available For Extensibility
To explicitly state the extensibility points that are available:
* At the schema level
.Schema Plugins
|===
|Name| Description

| `ModelBuilderPlugin`
| for enriching models

| `ModelPropertyBuilderPlugin`
| for enriching model properties

| `TypeNameProviderPlugin`
| these are for overriding names for models
|===


.Service Plugins
|===
|Name| Description

| `ApiListingScannerPlugin`
| for adding custom api descriptions

| `ApiListingBuilderPlugin`
| for enriching api listings

| `DefaultsProviderPlugin`
| for providing your own defaults

| `DocumentationPlugin`
| for enriching the documentation context

| `ExpandedParameterBuilderPlugin`
| for parameter expansion used in the context of `@ModelAttribute`

| `OperationBuilderPlugin`
| for enriching operations

| `OperationModelsProviderPlugin`
| for providing additional models that you might load a different way

| `ParameterBuilderPlugin`
| for enriching parameters
|===


=== Steps To Create A Plugin

TIP: The ___same___ patterns apply to all of the extensibility mechanisms

1. Implement one of the above plugin interfaces
2. Give the plugin an order for e.g. https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-swagger-common/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/swagger/readers/parameter/ApiParamParameterBuilder.java#L42[ApiParamParameterBuilder] has an
 order specified in the bean. In general spring plugins get the highest priority, The swagger plugins (the ones that process all the `@Api...` annotations) layer information on top. So the order that you'd write will need to layer information at the end.
3. Each plugin has
     - a https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-swagger-common/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/swagger/readers/parameter/ApiParamParameterBuilder.java#L47[*context] and provides access to any information that the plugin might need to do its job
     - a https://github.com/springfox/springfox/blob/master/springfox-swagger-common/src/main/java/springfox/documentation/swagger/readers/parameter/ApiParamParameterBuilder.java#L49[*builder] for the type of object that the plugin is intended to support for e.g. a `ModelPropertyBuilderPlugin` will have access to a `ModelPropertyBuilder`. This builder is what is used to build the model _after_ all the plugins have had access to contribute/enrich the underlying object.
4. Update any builder properties your plugin cares about
5. Register the plugin as a `@bean`, so that the plugin registry can pick it up.

That is it!
